                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Over fifteen years ago I had my first cigar encounter.
                    I reference this day as more than just smoking a cigar,
                    it was an “experience”. Not only did I enjoy the taste of the cigar,
                    the diversity of those I shared it with created a cultural awareness
                    that I had never felt.
                </p>
                <p>For me, smoking cigars is more than just tobacco and smoke.
                    You lose yourself in your surroundings and conversations with those
                    around you.  Like the smoke, your stress, worries, and problems fade
                    away and only peaceful thoughts remain.
                </p>
                <p>Since that first encounter, I have dreamed of creating an environment
                    for cigar smokers of all levels and backgrounds to not just have the
                     basic experience of smoking a cigar. Instead, I have made it my
                     mission to use Stets & Stixx Mobile Cigar bar to encourage other
                     cigar smokers to also expand their circle of friends, create new
                     business relationships, and cultivate an elevated level of shared
                     appreciation and passion for fine cigars.
                </p>
                <p>Over the years, this mission has become my passion. I am enthusiastic
                    about raising the bar for service and ambience to set a new standard
                    for cigar aficionados like myself. Join me in creating a positive,
                     diverse, and refined atmosphere where all can relax, unwind and
                     put some smoke in the air.
                </p>
